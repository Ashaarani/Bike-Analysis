# Bike Sales Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project involves analyzing bike sales data using Excel to uncover insights and trends. The analysis focuses on various aspects such as customer demographics, commuting patterns, and income levels. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project is provided in the file `Excel Project Dataset.xlsx`. It contains multiple sheets with data collected on bike sales and customer demographics. Each sheet in the Excel file represents a unique aspect or category of the data.

### Sheets and Columns

- **Dashboard**: A visual representation of key insights derived from the dataset, including charts on customer commute, age groups, marital status, region, and occupation.
  - Charts:
    - Customer Commute Based on Gender
    - Customer Age Group
    - Average Income per Purchase
    - Customer Commute Patterns
- **Working Sheet**: The primary data used for analysis, including columns such as gender, age, marital status, region, occupation, commute distance, and income.
- **Pivot Table**: Summarizes the data for quick insights and analysis using pivot tables.

## Goals and Objectives

The primary goals of this project are:

1. To clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns.
3. To visualize the data using various charts and graphs for better understanding and presentation.
4. To derive actionable insights and conclusions from the analysis.

## Methodology

The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting any inconsistencies in the data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using descriptive statistics and visualizations to explore the data.
3. **Data Visualization**: Creating charts and graphs such as histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts to represent the data visually.
4. **Analysis and Interpretation**: Analyzing the visualizations to draw meaningful conclusions and insights.

## Results

The key findings from the analysis are:

1. **Customer Commute Based on Gender**: Both male and female customers have similar commuting patterns, with a significant number commuting 0-1 miles and more than 10 miles.
2. **Customer Age Group**: Middle-aged customers form the largest age group, with a significant number being married.
3. **Average Income per Purchase**: Male customers with a higher average income per purchase are more likely to buy bikes compared to female customers.

## Conclusions

Based on the analysis, the following conclusions were drawn:

1. **Commute Patterns**: Most customers commute either very short distances (0-1 miles) or long distances (more than 10 miles), indicating a diverse range of bike usage.
2. **Demographics**: Middle-aged, married individuals form the primary customer base, highlighting a key demographic for marketing efforts.
3. **Income and Purchase**: Higher-income individuals, particularly males, are more likely to make bike purchases, suggesting income level as a crucial factor in sales.
